Fascinated by technology and how it is capable to improve people's lives. My experiences in different areas such as web development, embedded software, test automation and devOps show my great flexibility and ease at working with different tasks.
Commitment, organization and teamwork are among my skill, besides my technical abilities. However my passion for what i do is my main strenght, leading me to give my all and never give up on a problem. I see problems as great oportunities for personal and professional development.
